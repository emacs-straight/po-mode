1 Overview
**********

   A _PO file_ contains translations of messages that a program might
show to the user, for a specific language (or, in some cases, for a
dialect of a language).

   The Emacs PO mode is an editor for PO files, implemented as an Emacs
mode.

   Please submit suggestions and corrections
   • either in the bug tracker at
     <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gettext>
   • or by email to ‘bug-gettext@gnu.org’.

2.1 Emacs's PO File Editor
==========================

   For those of you being the lucky users of Emacs, PO mode has been
specifically created for providing a cozy environment for editing or
modifying PO files.  While editing a PO file, PO mode allows for the
easy browsing of auxiliary and compendium PO files, as well as for
following references into the set of C program sources from which PO
files have been derived.  It has a few special features, among which are
the interactive marking of program strings as translatable, and the
validation of PO files with easy repositioning to PO file lines showing
errors.

   For the beginning, besides main PO mode commands (*note Main PO
Commands::), you should know how to move between entries (*note Entry
Positioning::), and how to handle untranslated entries (*note
Untranslated Entries::).

File: po-mode.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Main PO Commands,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.1 Completing GNU ‘gettext’ Installation
-------------------------------------------

   Once you have received, unpacked, configured and compiled the GNU
‘gettext’ distribution, the ‘make install’ command puts in place the
programs ‘xgettext’, ‘msgfmt’, ‘gettext’, and ‘msgmerge’, as well as
their available message catalogs.  To top off a comfortable
installation, you might also want to make the PO mode available to your
Emacs users.

   During the installation of the PO mode, you might want to modify your
file ‘.emacs’, once and for all, so it contains a few lines looking
like:

     (setq auto-mode-alist
           (cons '("\\.po\\'\\|\\.po\\." . po-mode) auto-mode-alist))
     (autoload 'po-mode "po-mode" "Major mode for translators to edit PO files" t)

   Later, whenever you edit some ‘.po’ file, or any file having the
string ‘.po.’ within its name, Emacs loads ‘po-mode.elc’ (or
‘po-mode.el’) as needed, and automatically activates PO mode commands
for the associated buffer.  The string _PO_ appears in the mode line for
any buffer for which PO mode is active.  Many PO files may be active at
once in a single Emacs session.

   If you are using Emacs version 20 or newer, and have already
installed the appropriate international fonts on your system, you may
also tell Emacs how to determine automatically the coding system of
every PO file.  This will often (but not always) cause the necessary
fonts to be loaded and used for displaying the translations on your
Emacs screen.  For this to happen, add the lines:

     (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.po\\'\\|\\.po\\."
                                 'po-find-file-coding-system)
     (autoload 'po-find-file-coding-system "po-mode")

to your ‘.emacs’ file.  If, with this, you still see boxes instead of
international characters, try a different font set (via Shift Mouse
button 1).


File: po-mode.info,  Node: Main PO Commands,  Next: Entry Positioning,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.2 Main PO mode Commands
---------------------------

   After setting up Emacs with something similar to the lines in *note
Installation::, PO mode is activated for a window when Emacs finds a PO
file in that window.  This puts the window read-only and establishes a
po-mode-map, which is a genuine Emacs mode, in a way that is not derived
from text mode in any way.  Functions found on ‘po-mode-hook’, if any,
will be executed.

   When PO mode is active in a window, the letters ‘PO’ appear in the
mode line for that window.  The mode line also displays how many entries
of each kind are held in the PO file.  For example, the string
‘132t+3f+10u+2o’ would tell the translator that the PO mode contains 132
translated entries (*note Translated Entries::, 3 fuzzy entries (*note
Fuzzy Entries::), 10 untranslated entries (*note Untranslated Entries::)
and 2 obsolete entries (*note Obsolete Entries::).  Zero-coefficients
items are not shown.  So, in this example, if the fuzzy entries were
unfuzzied, the untranslated entries were translated and the obsolete
entries were deleted, the mode line would merely display ‘145t’ for the
counters.

   The main PO commands are those which do not fit into the other
categories of subsequent sections.  These allow for quitting PO mode or
for managing windows in special ways.

‘_’
     Undo last modification to the PO file (‘po-undo’).

‘Q’
     Quit processing and save the PO file (‘po-quit’).

‘q’
     Quit processing, possibly after confirmation
     (‘po-confirm-and-quit’).

‘0’
     Temporary leave the PO file window (‘po-other-window’).

‘?’
‘h’
     Show help about PO mode (‘po-help’).

‘=’
     Give some PO file statistics (‘po-statistics’).

‘V’
     Batch validate the format of the whole PO file (‘po-validate’).

   The command ‘_’ (‘po-undo’) interfaces to the Emacs _undo_ facility.
*Note Undoing Changes: (emacs)Undo.  Each time ‘_’ is typed,
modifications which the translator did to the PO file are undone a
little more.  For the purpose of undoing, each PO mode command is
atomic.  This is especially true for the ‘<RET>’ command: the whole
edition made by using a single use of this command is undone at once,
even if the edition itself implied several actions.  However, while in
the editing window, one can undo the edition work quite parsimoniously.

   The commands ‘Q’ (‘po-quit’) and ‘q’ (‘po-confirm-and-quit’) are used
when the translator is done with the PO file.  The former is a bit less
verbose than the latter.  If the file has been modified, it is saved to
disk first.  In both cases, and prior to all this, the commands check if
any untranslated messages remain in the PO file and, if so, the
translator is asked if she really wants to leave off working with this
PO file.  This is the preferred way of getting rid of an Emacs PO file
buffer.  Merely killing it through the usual command ‘C-x k’
(‘kill-buffer’) is not the tidiest way to proceed.

   The command ‘0’ (‘po-other-window’) is another, softer way, to leave
PO mode, temporarily.  It just moves the cursor to some other Emacs
window, and pops one if necessary.  For example, if the translator just
got PO mode to show some source context in some other, she might
discover some apparent bug in the program source that needs correction.
This command allows the translator to change sex, become a programmer,
and have the cursor right into the window containing the program she (or
rather _he_) wants to modify.  By later getting the cursor back in the
PO file window, or by asking Emacs to edit this file once again, PO mode
is then recovered.

   The command ‘h’ (‘po-help’) displays a summary of all available PO
mode commands.  The translator should then type any character to resume
normal PO mode operations.  The command ‘?’ has the same effect as ‘h’.

   The command ‘=’ (‘po-statistics’) computes the total number of
entries in the PO file, the ordinal of the current entry (counted from
1), the number of untranslated entries, the number of obsolete entries,
and displays all these numbers.

   The command ‘V’ (‘po-validate’) launches ‘msgfmt’ in checking and
verbose mode over the current PO file.  This command first offers to
save the current PO file on disk.  The ‘msgfmt’ tool, from GNU
‘gettext’, has the purpose of creating a MO file out of a PO file, and
PO mode uses the features of this program for checking the overall
format of a PO file, as well as all individual entries.

   The program ‘msgfmt’ runs asynchronously with Emacs, so the
translator regains control immediately while her PO file is being
studied.  Error output is collected in the Emacs ‘*compilation*’ buffer,
displayed in another window.  The regular Emacs command ‘C-x`’
(‘next-error’), as well as other usual compile commands, allow the
translator to reposition quickly to the offending parts of the PO file.
Once the cursor is on the line in error, the translator may decide on
any PO mode action which would help correcting the error.


File: po-mode.info,  Node: Entry Positioning,  Next: Normalizing,  Prev: Main PO Commands,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.3 Entry Positioning
-----------------------

   The cursor in a PO file window is almost always part of an entry.
The only exceptions are the special case when the cursor is after the
last entry in the file, or when the PO file is empty.  The entry where
the cursor is found to be is said to be the current entry.  Many PO mode
commands operate on the current entry, so moving the cursor does more
than allowing the translator to browse the PO file, this also selects on
which entry commands operate.

   Some PO mode commands alter the position of the cursor in a
specialized way.  A few of those special purpose positioning are
described here, the others are described in following sections (for a
complete list try ‘C-h m’):

‘.’
     Redisplay the current entry (‘po-current-entry’).

‘n’
     Select the entry after the current one (‘po-next-entry’).

‘p’
     Select the entry before the current one (‘po-previous-entry’).

‘<’
     Select the first entry in the PO file (‘po-first-entry’).

‘>’
     Select the last entry in the PO file (‘po-last-entry’).

‘m’
     Record the location of the current entry for later use
     (‘po-push-location’).

‘r’
     Return to a previously saved entry location (‘po-pop-location’).

‘x’
     Exchange the current entry location with the previously saved one
     (‘po-exchange-location’).

   Any Emacs command able to reposition the cursor may be used to select
the current entry in PO mode, including commands which move by
characters, lines, paragraphs, screens or pages, and search commands.
However, there is a kind of standard way to display the current entry in
PO mode, which usual Emacs commands moving the cursor do not especially
try to enforce.  The command ‘.’ (‘po-current-entry’) has the sole
purpose of redisplaying the current entry properly, after the current
entry has been changed by means external to PO mode, or the Emacs screen
otherwise altered.

   It is yet to be decided if PO mode helps the translator, or otherwise
irritates her, by forcing a rigid window disposition while she is doing
her work.  We originally had quite precise ideas about how windows
should behave, but on the other hand, anyone used to Emacs is often
happy to keep full control.  Maybe a fixed window disposition might be
offered as a PO mode option that the translator might activate or
deactivate at will, so it could be offered on an experimental basis.  If
nobody feels a real need for using it, or a compulsion for writing it,
we should drop this whole idea.  The incentive for doing it should come
from translators rather than programmers, as opinions from an
experienced translator are surely more worth to me than opinions from
programmers _thinking_ about how _others_ should do translation.

   The commands ‘n’ (‘po-next-entry’) and ‘p’ (‘po-previous-entry’) move
the cursor the entry following, or preceding, the current one.  If ‘n’
is given while the cursor is on the last entry of the PO file, or if ‘p’
is given while the cursor is on the first entry, no move is done.

   The commands ‘<’ (‘po-first-entry’) and ‘>’ (‘po-last-entry’) move
the cursor to the first entry, or last entry, of the PO file.  When the
cursor is located past the last entry in a PO file, most PO mode
commands will return an error saying ‘After last entry’.  Moreover, the
commands ‘<’ and ‘>’ have the special property of being able to work
even when the cursor is not into some PO file entry, and one may use
them for nicely correcting this situation.  But even these commands will
fail on a truly empty PO file.  There are development plans for the PO
mode for it to interactively fill an empty PO file from sources.  *Note
Marking::.

   The translator may decide, before working at the translation of a
particular entry, that she needs to browse the remainder of the PO file,
maybe for finding the terminology or phraseology used in related
entries.  She can of course use the standard Emacs idioms for saving the
current cursor location in some register, and use that register for
getting back, or else, use the location ring.

   PO mode offers another approach, by which cursor locations may be
saved onto a special stack.  The command ‘m’ (‘po-push-location’) merely
adds the location of current entry to the stack, pushing the already
saved locations under the new one.  The command ‘r’ (‘po-pop-location’)
consumes the top stack element and repositions the cursor to the entry
associated with that top element.  This position is then lost, for the
next ‘r’ will move the cursor to the previously saved location, and so
on until no locations remain on the stack.

   If the translator wants the position to be kept on the location
stack, maybe for taking a look at the entry associated with the top
element, then go elsewhere with the intent of getting back later, she
ought to use ‘m’ immediately after ‘r’.

   The command ‘x’ (‘po-exchange-location’) simultaneously repositions
the cursor to the entry associated with the top element of the stack of
saved locations, and replaces that top element with the location of the
current entry before the move.  Consequently, repeating the ‘x’ command
toggles alternatively between two entries.  For achieving this, the
translator will position the cursor on the first entry, use ‘m’, then
position to the second entry, and merely use ‘x’ for making the switch.

2.1.4 Normalizing Strings in Entries
------------------------------------

   There are many different ways for encoding a particular string into a
PO file entry, because there are so many different ways to split and
quote multi-line strings, and even, to represent special characters by
backslashed escaped sequences.  Some features of PO mode rely on the
ability for PO mode to scan an already existing PO file for a particular
string encoded into the ‘msgid’ field of some entry.  Even if PO mode
has internally all the built-in machinery for implementing this
recognition easily, doing it fast is technically difficult.  To
facilitate a solution to this efficiency problem, we decided on a
canonical representation for strings.

   A conventional representation of strings in a PO file is currently
under discussion, and PO mode experiments with a canonical
representation.  Having both ‘xgettext’ and PO mode converging towards a
uniform way of representing equivalent strings would be useful, as the
internal normalization needed by PO mode could be automatically
satisfied when using ‘xgettext’ from GNU ‘gettext’.  An explicit PO mode
normalization should then be only necessary for PO files imported from
elsewhere, or for when the convention itself evolves.

   So, for achieving normalization of at least the strings of a given PO
file needing a canonical representation, the following PO mode command
is available:

‘M-x po-normalize’
     Tidy the whole PO file by making entries more uniform.

   The special command ‘M-x po-normalize’, which has no associated keys,
revises all entries, ensuring that strings of both original and
translated entries use uniform internal quoting in the PO file.  It also
removes any crumb after the last entry.  This command may be useful for
PO files freshly imported from elsewhere, or if we ever improve on the
canonical quoting format we use.  This canonical format is not only
meant for getting cleaner PO files, but also for greatly speeding up
‘msgid’ string lookup for some other PO mode commands.

   ‘M-x po-normalize’ presently makes three passes over the entries.
The first implements heuristics for converting PO files for GNU
‘gettext’ 0.6 and earlier, in which ‘msgid’ and ‘msgstr’ fields were
using K&R style C string syntax for multi-line strings.  These
heuristics may fail for comments not related to obsolete entries and
ending with a backslash; they also depend on subsequent passes for
finalizing the proper commenting of continued lines for obsolete
entries.  This first pass might disappear once all oldish PO files would
have been adjusted.  The second and third pass normalize all ‘msgid’ and
‘msgstr’ strings respectively.  They also clean out those trailing
backslashes used by XView's ‘msgfmt’ for continued lines.

   Having such an explicit normalizing command allows for importing PO
files from other sources, but also eases the evolution of the current
convention, evolution driven mostly by aesthetic concerns, as of now.
It is easy to make suggested adjustments at a later time, as the
normalizing command and eventually, other GNU ‘gettext’ tools should
greatly automate conformance.  A description of the canonical string
format is given below, for the particular benefit of those not having
Emacs handy, and who would nevertheless want to handcraft their PO files
in nice ways.

   Right now, in PO mode, strings are single line or multi-line.  A
string goes multi-line if and only if it has _embedded_ newlines, that
is, if it matches ‘[^\n]\n+[^\n]’.  So, we would have:

     msgstr "\n\nHello, world!\n\n\n"

   but, replacing the space by a newline, this becomes:

     msgstr ""
     "\n"
     "\n"
     "Hello,\n"
     "world!\n"
     "\n"
     "\n"

   We are deliberately using a caricatural example, here, to make the
point clearer.  Usually, multi-lines are not that bad looking.  It is
probable that we will implement the following suggestion.  We might lump
together all initial newlines into the empty string, and also all
newlines introducing empty lines (that is, for N > 1, the N-1'th last
newlines would go together on a separate string), so making the previous
example appear:

     msgstr "\n\n"
     "Hello,\n"
     "world!\n"
     "\n\n"

   There are a few yet undecided little points about string
normalization, to be documented in this manual, once these questions
settle.


File: po-mode.info,  Node: Translated Entries,  Next: Fuzzy Entries,  Prev: Normalizing,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.5 Translated Entries
------------------------

   Each PO file entry for which the ‘msgstr’ field has been filled with
a translation, and which is not marked as fuzzy (*note Fuzzy Entries::),
is said to be a “translated” entry.  Only translated entries will later
be compiled by GNU ‘msgfmt’ and become usable in programs.  Other entry
types will be excluded; translation will not occur for them.

   Some commands are more specifically related to translated entry
processing.

‘t’
     Find the next translated entry (‘po-next-translated-entry’).

‘T’
     Find the previous translated entry
     (‘po-previous-translated-entry’).

   The commands ‘t’ (‘po-next-translated-entry’) and ‘T’
(‘po-previous-translated-entry’) move forwards or backwards, chasing for
an translated entry.  If none is found, the search is extended and wraps
around in the PO file buffer.

   Translated entries usually result from the translator having edited
in a translation for them, *note Modifying Translations::.  However, if
the variable ‘po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit’ is not ‘nil’, the entry having
received a new translation first becomes a fuzzy entry, which ought to
be later unfuzzied before becoming an official, genuine translated
entry.  *Note Fuzzy Entries::.


File: po-mode.info,  Node: Fuzzy Entries,  Next: Untranslated Entries,  Prev: Translated Entries,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.6 Fuzzy Entries
-------------------

   Each PO file entry may have a set of “attributes”, which are
qualities given a name and explicitly associated with the translation,
using a special system comment.  One of these attributes has the name
‘fuzzy’, and entries having this attribute are said to have a fuzzy
translation.  They are called fuzzy entries, for short.

   Fuzzy entries, even if they account for translated entries for most
other purposes, usually call for revision by the translator.  Those may
be produced by applying the program ‘msgmerge’ to update an older
translated PO files according to a new PO template file, when this tool
hypothesises that some new ‘msgid’ has been modified only slightly out
of an older one, and chooses to pair what it thinks to be the old
translation for the new modified entry.  The slight alteration in the
original string (the ‘msgid’ string) should often be reflected in the
translated string, and this requires the intervention of the translator.
For this reason, ‘msgmerge’ might mark some entries as being fuzzy.

   Also, the translator may decide herself to mark an entry as fuzzy for
her own convenience, when she wants to remember that the entry has to be
later revisited.  So, some commands are more specifically related to
fuzzy entry processing.

‘f’
     Find the next fuzzy entry (‘po-next-fuzzy-entry’).

‘F’
     Find the previous fuzzy entry (‘po-previous-fuzzy-entry’).

‘<TAB>’
     Remove the fuzzy attribute of the current entry (‘po-unfuzzy’).

   The commands ‘f’ (‘po-next-fuzzy-entry’) and ‘F’
(‘po-previous-fuzzy-entry’) move forwards or backwards, chasing for a
fuzzy entry.  If none is found, the search is extended and wraps around
in the PO file buffer.

   The command ‘<TAB>’ (‘po-unfuzzy’) removes the fuzzy attribute
associated with an entry, usually leaving it translated.  Further, if
the variable ‘po-auto-select-on-unfuzzy’ has not the ‘nil’ value, the
‘<TAB>’ command will automatically chase for another interesting entry
to work on.  The initial value of ‘po-auto-select-on-unfuzzy’ is ‘nil’.

   The initial value of ‘po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit’ is ‘nil’.  However, if
the variable ‘po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit’ is set to ‘t’, any entry edited
through the ‘<RET>’ command is marked fuzzy, as a way to ensure some
kind of double check, later.  In this case, the usual paradigm is that
an entry becomes fuzzy (if not already) whenever the translator modifies
it.  If she is satisfied with the translation, she then uses ‘<TAB>’ to
pick another entry to work on, clearing the fuzzy attribute on the same
blow.  If she is not satisfied yet, she merely uses ‘<SPC>’ to chase
another entry, leaving the entry fuzzy.

   The translator may also use the ‘<DEL>’ command (‘po-fade-out-entry’)
over any translated entry to mark it as being fuzzy, when she wants to
easily leave a trace she wants to later return working at this entry.

   Also, when time comes to quit working on a PO file buffer with the
‘q’ command, the translator is asked for confirmation, if fuzzy string
still exists.


File: po-mode.info,  Node: Untranslated Entries,  Next: Obsolete Entries,  Prev: Fuzzy Entries,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.7 Untranslated Entries
--------------------------

   When ‘xgettext’ originally creates a PO file, unless told otherwise,
it initializes the ‘msgid’ field with the untranslated string, and
leaves the ‘msgstr’ string to be empty.  Such entries, having an empty
translation, are said to be “untranslated” entries.  Later, when the
programmer slightly modifies some string right in the program, this
change is later reflected in the PO file by the appearance of a new
untranslated entry for the modified string.

   The usual commands moving from entry to entry consider untranslated
entries on the same level as active entries.  Untranslated entries are
easily recognizable by the fact they end with ‘msgstr ""’.

   The work of the translator might be (quite naively) seen as the
process of seeking for an untranslated entry, editing a translation for
it, and repeating these actions until no untranslated entries remain.
Some commands are more specifically related to untranslated entry
processing.

‘u’
     Find the next untranslated entry (‘po-next-untranslated-entry’).

‘U’
     Find the previous untranslated entry
     (‘po-previous-untransted-entry’).

‘k’
     Turn the current entry into an untranslated one (‘po-kill-msgstr’).

   The commands ‘u’ (‘po-next-untranslated-entry’) and ‘U’
(‘po-previous-untransted-entry’) move forwards or backwards, chasing for
an untranslated entry.  If none is found, the search is extended and
wraps around in the PO file buffer.

   An entry can be turned back into an untranslated entry by merely
emptying its translation, using the command ‘k’ (‘po-kill-msgstr’).
*Note Modifying Translations::.

   Also, when time comes to quit working on a PO file buffer with the
‘q’ command, the translator is asked for confirmation, if some
untranslated string still exists.

2.1.8 Obsolete Entries
----------------------

   By “obsolete” PO file entries, we mean those entries which are
commented out, usually by ‘msgmerge’ when it found that the translation
is not needed anymore by the package being localized.

   The usual commands moving from entry to entry consider obsolete
entries on the same level as active entries.  Obsolete entries are
easily recognizable by the fact that all their lines start with ‘#’,
even those lines containing ‘msgid’ or ‘msgstr’.

   Commands exist for emptying the translation or reinitializing it to
the original untranslated string.  Commands interfacing with the kill
ring may force some previously saved text into the translation.  The
user may interactively edit the translation.  All these commands may
apply to obsolete entries, carefully leaving the entry obsolete after
the fact.

   Moreover, some commands are more specifically related to obsolete
entry processing.

‘o’
     Find the next obsolete entry (‘po-next-obsolete-entry’).

‘O’
     Find the previous obsolete entry (‘po-previous-obsolete-entry’).

‘<DEL>’
     Make an active entry obsolete, or zap out an obsolete entry
     (‘po-fade-out-entry’).

   The commands ‘o’ (‘po-next-obsolete-entry’) and ‘O’
(‘po-previous-obsolete-entry’) move forwards or backwards, chasing for
an obsolete entry.  If none is found, the search is extended and wraps
around in the PO file buffer.

   PO mode does not provide ways for un-commenting an obsolete entry and
making it active, because this would reintroduce an original
untranslated string which does not correspond to any marked string in
the program sources.  This goes with the philosophy of never introducing
useless ‘msgid’ values.

   However, it is possible to comment out an active entry, so making it
obsolete.  GNU ‘gettext’ utilities will later react to the disappearance
of a translation by using the untranslated string.  The command ‘<DEL>’
(‘po-fade-out-entry’) pushes the current entry a little further towards
annihilation.  If the entry is active (it is a translated entry), then
it is first made fuzzy.  If it is already fuzzy, then the entry is
merely commented out, with confirmation.  If the entry is already
obsolete, then it is completely deleted from the PO file.  It is easy to
recycle the translation so deleted into some other PO file entry,
usually one which is untranslated.  *Note Modifying Translations::.

   Here is a quite interesting problem to solve for later development of
PO mode, for those nights you are not sleepy.  The idea would be that PO
mode might become bright enough, one of these days, to make good guesses
at retrieving the most probable candidate, among all obsolete entries,
for initializing the translation of a newly appeared string.  I think it
might be a quite hard problem to do this algorithmically, as we have to
develop good and efficient measures of string similarity.  Right now, PO
mode completely lets the decision to the translator, when the time comes
to find the adequate obsolete translation, it merely tries to provide
handy tools for helping her to do so.

2.1.9 Modifying Translations
----------------------------

   PO mode prevents direct modification of the PO file, by the usual
means Emacs gives for altering a buffer's contents.  By doing so, it
pretends helping the translator to avoid little clerical errors about
the overall file format, or the proper quoting of strings, as those
errors would be easily made.  Other kinds of errors are still possible,
but some may be caught and diagnosed by the batch validation process,
which the translator may always trigger by the ‘V’ command.  For all
other errors, the translator has to rely on her own judgment, and also
on the linguistic reports submitted to her by the users of the
translated package, having the same mother tongue.

   When the time comes to create a translation, correct an error
diagnosed mechanically or reported by a user, the translators have to
resort to using the following commands for modifying the translations.

‘<RET>’
     Interactively edit the translation (‘po-edit-msgstr’).

‘<LFD>’
‘C-j’
     Reinitialize the translation with the original, untranslated string
     (‘po-msgid-to-msgstr’).

‘k’
     Save the translation on the kill ring, and delete it
     (‘po-kill-msgstr’).

‘w’
     Save the translation on the kill ring, without deleting it
     (‘po-kill-ring-save-msgstr’).

‘y’
     Replace the translation, taking the new from the kill ring
     (‘po-yank-msgstr’).

   The command ‘<RET>’ (‘po-edit-msgstr’) opens a new Emacs window meant
to edit in a new translation, or to modify an already existing
translation.  The new window contains a copy of the translation taken
from the current PO file entry, all ready for edition, expunged of all
quoting marks, fully modifiable and with the complete extent of Emacs
modifying commands.  When the translator is done with her modifications,
she may use ‘C-c C-c’ to close the subedit window with the automatically
requoted results, or ‘C-c C-k’ to abort her modifications.  *Note
Subedit::, for more information.

   The command ‘<LFD>’ (‘po-msgid-to-msgstr’) initializes, or
reinitializes the translation with the original string.  This command is
normally used when the translator wants to redo a fresh translation of
the original string, disregarding any previous work.

   It is possible to arrange so, whenever editing an untranslated entry,
the ‘<LFD>’ command be automatically executed.  If you set
‘po-auto-edit-with-msgid’ to ‘t’, the translation gets initialised with
the original string, in case none exists already.  The default value for
‘po-auto-edit-with-msgid’ is ‘nil’.

   In fact, whether it is best to start a translation with an empty
string, or rather with a copy of the original string, is a matter of
taste or habit.  Sometimes, the source language and the target language
are so different that is simply best to start writing on an empty page.
At other times, the source and target languages are so close that it
would be a waste to retype a number of words already being written in
the original string.  A translator may also like having the original
string right under her eyes, as she will progressively overwrite the
original text with the translation, even if this requires some extra
editing work to get rid of the original.

   The command ‘k’ (‘po-kill-msgstr’) merely empties the translation
string, so turning the entry into an untranslated one.  But while doing
so, its previous contents is put apart in a special place, known as the
kill ring.  The command ‘w’ (‘po-kill-ring-save-msgstr’) has also the
effect of taking a copy of the translation onto the kill ring, but it
otherwise leaves the entry alone, and does _not_ remove the translation
from the entry.  Both commands use exactly the Emacs kill ring, which is
shared between buffers, and which is well known already to Emacs lovers.

   The translator may use ‘k’ or ‘w’ many times in the course of her
work, as the kill ring may hold several saved translations.  From the
kill ring, strings may later be reinserted in various Emacs buffers.  In
particular, the kill ring may be used for moving translation strings
between different entries of a single PO file buffer, or if the
translator is handling many such buffers at once, even between PO files.

   To facilitate exchanges with buffers which are not in PO mode, the
translation string put on the kill ring by the ‘k’ command is fully
unquoted before being saved: external quotes are removed, multi-line
strings are concatenated, and backslash escaped sequences are turned
into their corresponding characters.  In the special case of obsolete
entries, the translation is also uncommented prior to saving.

   The command ‘y’ (‘po-yank-msgstr’) completely replaces the
translation of the current entry by a string taken from the kill ring.
Following Emacs terminology, we then say that the replacement string is
“yanked” into the PO file buffer.  *Note (emacs)Yanking::.  The first
time ‘y’ is used, the translation receives the value of the most recent
addition to the kill ring.  If ‘y’ is typed once again, immediately,
without intervening keystrokes, the translation just inserted is taken
away and replaced by the second most recent addition to the kill ring.
By repeating ‘y’ many times in a row, the translator may travel along
the kill ring for saved strings, until she finds the string she really
wanted.

   When a string is yanked into a PO file entry, it is fully and
automatically requoted for complying with the format PO files should
have.  Further, if the entry is obsolete, PO mode then appropriately
push the inserted string inside comments.  Once again, translators
should not burden themselves with quoting considerations besides, of
course, the necessity of the translated string itself respective to the
program using it.

   Note that ‘k’ or ‘w’ are not the only commands pushing strings on the
kill ring, as almost any PO mode command replacing translation strings
(or the translator comments) automatically saves the old string on the
kill ring.  The main exceptions to this general rule are the yanking
commands themselves.

   To better illustrate the operation of killing and yanking, let's use
an actual example, taken from a common situation.  When the programmer
slightly modifies some string right in the program, his change is later
reflected in the PO file by the appearance of a new untranslated entry
for the modified string, and the fact that the entry translating the
original or unmodified string becomes obsolete.  In many cases, the
translator might spare herself some work by retrieving the unmodified
translation from the obsolete entry, then initializing the untranslated
entry ‘msgstr’ field with this retrieved translation.  Once this done,
the obsolete entry is not wanted anymore, and may be safely deleted.

   When the translator finds an untranslated entry and suspects that a
slight variant of the translation exists, she immediately uses ‘m’ to
mark the current entry location, then starts chasing obsolete entries
with ‘o’, hoping to find some translation corresponding to the
unmodified string.  Once found, she uses the ‘<DEL>’ command for
deleting the obsolete entry, knowing that ‘<DEL>’ also _kills_ the
translation, that is, pushes the translation on the kill ring.  Then,
‘r’ returns to the initial untranslated entry, and ‘y’ then _yanks_ the
saved translation right into the ‘msgstr’ field.  The translator is then
free to use ‘<RET>’ for fine tuning the translation contents, and maybe
to later use ‘u’, then ‘m’ again, for going on with the next
untranslated string.

   When some sequence of keys has to be typed over and over again, the
translator may find it useful to become better acquainted with the Emacs
capability of learning these sequences and playing them back under
request.  *Note (emacs)Keyboard Macros::.


File: po-mode.info,  Node: Modifying Comments,  Next: Subedit,  Prev: Modifying Translations,  Up: Editing PO files

2.1.10 Modifying Comments
-------------------------

   Any translation work done seriously will raise many linguistic
difficulties, for which decisions have to be made, and the choices
further documented.  These documents may be saved within the PO file in
form of translator comments, which the translator is free to create,
delete, or modify at will.  These comments may be useful to herself when
she returns to this PO file after a while.

   Comments not having whitespace after the initial ‘#’, for example,
those beginning with ‘#.’ or ‘#:’, are _not_ translator comments, they
are exclusively created by other ‘gettext’ tools.  So, the commands
below will never alter such system added comments, they are not meant
for the translator to modify.  *Note (gettext)PO Files::.

   The following commands are somewhat similar to those modifying
translations, so the general indications given for those apply here.
*Note Modifying Translations::.

‘#’
     Interactively edit the translator comments (‘po-edit-comment’).

‘K’
     Save the translator comments on the kill ring, and delete it
     (‘po-kill-comment’).

‘W’
     Save the translator comments on the kill ring, without deleting it
     (‘po-kill-ring-save-comment’).

‘Y’
     Replace the translator comments, taking the new from the kill ring
     (‘po-yank-comment’).

   These commands parallel PO mode commands for modifying the
translation strings, and behave much the same way as they do, except
that they handle this part of PO file comments meant for translator
usage, rather than the translation strings.  So, if the descriptions
given below are slightly succinct, it is because the full details have
already been given.  *Note Modifying Translations::.

   The command ‘#’ (‘po-edit-comment’) opens a new Emacs window
containing a copy of the translator comments on the current PO file
entry.  If there are no such comments, PO mode understands that the
translator wants to add a comment to the entry, and she is presented
with an empty screen.  Comment marks (‘#’) and the space following them
are automatically removed before edition, and reinstated after.  For
translator comments pertaining to obsolete entries, the uncommenting and
recommenting operations are done twice.  Once in the editing window, the
keys ‘C-c C-c’ allow the translator to tell she is finished with editing
the comment.  *Note Subedit::, for further details.

   Functions found on ‘po-subedit-mode-hook’, if any, are executed after
the string has been inserted in the edit buffer.

   The command ‘K’ (‘po-kill-comment’) gets rid of all translator
comments, while saving those comments on the kill ring.  The command ‘W’
(‘po-kill-ring-save-comment’) takes a copy of the translator comments on
the kill ring, but leaves them undisturbed in the current entry.  The
command ‘Y’ (‘po-yank-comment’) completely replaces the translator
comments by a string taken at the front of the kill ring.  When this
command is immediately repeated, the comments just inserted are
withdrawn, and replaced by other strings taken along the kill ring.

   On the kill ring, all strings have the same nature.  There is no
distinction between _translation_ strings and _translator comments_
strings.  So, for example, let's presume the translator has just
finished editing a translation, and wants to create a new translator
comment to document why the previous translation was not good, just to
remember what was the problem.  Foreseeing that she will do that in her
documentation, the translator may want to quote the previous translation
in her translator comments.  To do so, she may initialize the translator
comments with the previous translation, still at the head of the kill
ring.  Because editing already pushed the previous translation on the
kill ring, she merely has to type ‘M-w’ prior to ‘#’, and the previous
translation will be right there, all ready for being introduced by some
explanatory text.

   On the other hand, presume there are some translator comments already
and that the translator wants to add to those comments, instead of
wholly replacing them.  Then, she should edit the comment right away
with ‘#’.  Once inside the editing window, she can use the regular Emacs
commands ‘C-y’ (‘yank’) and ‘M-y’ (‘yank-pop’) to get the previous
translation where she likes.

2.1.11 Details of Sub Edition
-----------------------------

   The PO subedit minor mode has a few peculiarities worth being
described in fuller detail.  It installs a few commands over the usual
editing set of Emacs, which are described below.

‘C-c C-c’
     Complete edition (‘po-subedit-exit’).

‘C-c C-k’
     Abort edition (‘po-subedit-abort’).

‘C-c C-a’
     Consult auxiliary PO files (‘po-subedit-cycle-auxiliary’).

   The window's contents represents a translation for a given message,
or a translator comment.  The translator may modify this window to her
heart's content.  Once this is done, the command ‘C-c C-c’
(‘po-subedit-exit’) may be used to return the edited translation into
the PO file, replacing the original translation, even if it moved out of
sight or if buffers were switched.

   If the translator becomes unsatisfied with her translation or
comment, to the extent she prefers keeping what was existent prior to
the ‘<RET>’ or ‘#’ command, she may use the command ‘C-c C-k’
(‘po-subedit-abort’) to merely get rid of edition, while preserving the
original translation or comment.  Another way would be for her to exit
normally with ‘C-c C-c’, then type ‘U’ once for undoing the whole effect
of last edition.

   The command ‘C-c C-a’ (‘po-subedit-cycle-auxiliary’) allows for
glancing through translations already achieved in other languages,
directly while editing the current translation.  This may be quite
convenient when the translator is fluent at many languages, but of
course, only makes sense when such completed auxiliary PO files are
already available to her (*note Auxiliary::).

   Functions found on ‘po-subedit-mode-hook’, if any, are executed after
the string has been inserted in the edit buffer.

   While editing her translation, the translator should pay attention to
not inserting unwanted ‘<RET>’ (newline) characters at the end of the
translated string if those are not meant to be there, or to removing
such characters when they are required.  Since these characters are not
visible in the editing buffer, they are easily introduced by mistake.
To help her, ‘<RET>’ automatically puts the character ‘<’ at the end of
the string being edited, but this ‘<’ is not really part of the string.
On exiting the editing window with ‘C-c C-c’, PO mode automatically
removes such ‘<’ and all whitespace added after it.  If the translator
adds characters after the terminating ‘<’, it looses its delimiting
property and integrally becomes part of the string.  If she removes the
delimiting ‘<’, then the edited string is taken _as is_, with all
trailing newlines, even if invisible.  Also, if the translated string
ought to end itself with a genuine ‘<’, then the delimiting ‘<’ may not
be removed; so the string should appear, in the editing window, as
ending with two ‘<’ in a row.

   When a translation (or a comment) is being edited, the translator may
move the cursor back into the PO file buffer and freely move to other
entries, browsing at will.  If, with an edition pending, the translator
wanders in the PO file buffer, she may decide to start modifying another
entry.  Each entry being edited has its own subedit buffer.  It is
possible to simultaneously edit the translation _and_ the comment of a
single entry, or to edit entries in different PO files, all at once.
Typing ‘<RET>’ on a field already being edited merely resumes that
particular edit.  Yet, the translator should better be comfortable at
handling many Emacs windows!

   Pending subedits may be completed or aborted in any order, regardless
of how or when they were started.  When many subedits are pending and
the translator asks for quitting the PO file (with the ‘q’ command),
subedits are automatically resumed one at a time, so she may decide for
each of them.

2.1.12 C Sources Context
------------------------

   PO mode is particularly powerful when used with PO files created
through GNU ‘gettext’ utilities, as those utilities insert special
comments in the PO files they generate.  Some of these special comments
relate the PO file entry to exactly where the untranslated string
appears in the program sources.

   When the translator gets to an untranslated entry, she is fairly
often faced with an original string which is not as informative as it
normally should be, being succinct, cryptic, or otherwise ambiguous.
Before choosing how to translate the string, she needs to understand
better what the string really means and how tight the translation has to
be.  Most of the time, when problems arise, the only way left to make
her judgment is looking at the true program sources from where this
string originated, searching for surrounding comments the programmer
might have put in there, and looking around for helping clues of _any_
kind.

   Surely, when looking at program sources, the translator will receive
more help if she is a fluent programmer.  However, even if she is not
versed in programming and feels a little lost in C code, the translator
should not be shy at taking a look, once in a while.  It is most
probable that she will still be able to find some of the hints she
needs.  She will learn quickly to not feel uncomfortable in program
code, paying more attention to programmer's comments, variable and
function names (if he dared choosing them well), and overall
organization, than to the program code itself.

   The following commands are meant to help the translator at getting
program source context for a PO file entry.

‘s’
     Resume the display of a program source context, or cycle through
     them (‘po-cycle-source-reference’).

‘M-s’
     Display of a program source context selected by menu
     (‘po-select-source-reference’).

‘S’
     Add a directory to the search path for source files
     (‘po-consider-source-path’).

‘M-S’
     Delete a directory from the search path for source files
     (‘po-ignore-source-path’).

   The commands ‘s’ (‘po-cycle-source-reference’) and ‘M-s’
(‘po-select-source-reference’) both open another window displaying some
source program file, and already positioned in such a way that it shows
an actual use of the string to be translated.  By doing so, the command
gives source program context for the string.  But if the entry has no
source context references, or if all references are unresolved along the
search path for program sources, then the command diagnoses this as an
error.

   Even if ‘s’ (or ‘M-s’) opens a new window, the cursor stays in the PO
file window.  If the translator really wants to get into the program
source window, she ought to do it explicitly, maybe by using command
‘O’.

   When ‘s’ is typed for the first time, or for a PO file entry which is
different of the last one used for getting source context, then the
command reacts by giving the first context available for this entry, if
any.  If some context has already been recently displayed for the
current PO file entry, and the translator wandered off to do other
things, typing ‘s’ again will merely resume, in another window, the
context last displayed.  In particular, if the translator moved the
cursor away from the context in the source file, the command will bring
the cursor back to the context.  By using ‘s’ many times in a row, with
no other commands intervening, PO mode will cycle to the next available
contexts for this particular entry, getting back to the first context
once the last has been shown.

   The command ‘M-s’ behaves differently.  Instead of cycling through
references, it lets the translator choose a particular reference among
many, and displays that reference.  It is best used with completion, if
the translator types ‘<TAB>’ immediately after ‘M-s’, in response to the
question, she will be offered a menu of all possible references, as a
reminder of which are the acceptable answers.  This command is useful
only where there are really many contexts available for a single string
to translate.

   Program source files are usually found relative to where the PO file
stands.  As a special provision, when this fails, the file is also
looked for, but relative to the directory immediately above it.  Those
two cases take proper care of most PO files.  However, it might happen
that a PO file has been moved, or is edited in a different place than
its normal location.  When this happens, the translator should tell PO
mode in which directory normally sits the genuine PO file.  Many such
directories may be specified, and all together, they constitute what is
called the “search path” for program sources.  The command ‘S’
(‘po-consider-source-path’) is used to interactively enter a new
directory at the front of the search path, and the command ‘M-S’
(‘po-ignore-source-path’) is used to select, with completion, one of the
directories she does not want anymore on the search path.

2.1.13 Consulting Auxiliary PO Files
------------------------------------

   PO mode is able to help the knowledgeable translator, being fluent in
many languages, at taking advantage of translations already achieved in
other languages she just happens to know.  It provides these other
language translations as additional context for her own work.  Moreover,
it has features to ease the production of translations for many
languages at once, for translators preferring to work in this way.

   An “auxiliary” PO file is an existing PO file meant for the same
package the translator is working on, but targeted to a different mother
tongue language.  Commands exist for declaring and handling auxiliary PO
files, and also for showing contexts for the entry under work.

   Here are the auxiliary file commands available in PO mode.

‘a’
     Seek auxiliary files for another translation for the same entry
     (‘po-cycle-auxiliary’).

‘C-c C-a’
     Switch to a particular auxiliary file (‘po-select-auxiliary’).

‘A’
     Declare this PO file as an auxiliary file
     (‘po-consider-as-auxiliary’).

‘M-A’
     Remove this PO file from the list of auxiliary files
     (‘po-ignore-as-auxiliary’).

   Command ‘A’ (‘po-consider-as-auxiliary’) adds the current PO file to
the list of auxiliary files, while command ‘M-A’
(‘po-ignore-as-auxiliary’ just removes it.

   The command ‘a’ (‘po-cycle-auxiliary’) seeks all auxiliary PO files,
round-robin, searching for a translated entry in some other language
having an ‘msgid’ field identical as the one for the current entry.  The
found PO file, if any, takes the place of the current PO file in the
display (its window gets on top).  Before doing so, the current PO file
is also made into an auxiliary file, if not already.  So, ‘a’ in this
newly displayed PO file will seek another PO file, and so on, so
repeating ‘a’ will eventually yield back the original PO file.

   The command ‘C-c C-a’ (‘po-select-auxiliary’) asks the translator for
her choice of a particular auxiliary file, with completion, and then
switches to that selected PO file.  The command also checks if the
selected file has an ‘msgid’ field identical as the one for the current
entry, and if yes, this entry becomes current.  Otherwise, the cursor of
the selected file is left undisturbed.

   For all this to work fully, auxiliary PO files will have to be
normalized, in that way that ‘msgid’ fields should be written _exactly_
the same way.  It is possible to write ‘msgid’ fields in various ways
for representing the same string, different writing would break the
proper behaviour of the auxiliary file commands of PO mode.  This is not
expected to be much a problem in practice, as most existing PO files
have their ‘msgid’ entries written by the same GNU ‘gettext’ tools.

   However, PO files initially created by PO mode itself, while marking
strings in source files, are normalised differently.  So are PO files
resulting of the ‘M-x normalize’ command.  Until these discrepancies
between PO mode and other GNU ‘gettext’ tools get fully resolved, the
translator should stay aware of normalisation issues.

3 PO mode for programmers
*************************

   In PO mode, one set of features is meant more for the programmer than
for the translator, and allows him to interactively mark which strings,
in a set of program sources, are translatable, and which are not.  Even
if it is a fairly easy job for a programmer to find and mark such
strings by other means, using any editor of his choice, PO mode makes
this work more comfortable.  Further, this gives translators who feel a
little like programmers, or programmers who feel a little like
translators, a tool letting them work at marking translatable strings in
the program sources, while simultaneously producing a set of translation
in some language, for the package being internationalized.

3.1 Marking Translatable Strings
================================

   The set of program sources, targeted by the PO mode commands describe
here, should have an Emacs tags table constructed for your project,
prior to using these PO file commands.  This is easy to do.  In any
shell window, change the directory to the root of your project, then
execute a command resembling:

     etags src/*.[hc] lib/*.[hc]

presuming here you want to process all ‘.h’ and ‘.c’ files from the
‘src/’ and ‘lib/’ directories.  This command will explore all said files
and create a ‘TAGS’ file in your root directory, somewhat summarizing
the contents using a special file format Emacs can understand.

   For packages following the GNU coding standards, there is a make goal
‘tags’ or ‘TAGS’ which constructs the tag files in all directories and
for all files containing source code.

   Once your ‘TAGS’ file is ready, the following commands assist the
programmer at marking translatable strings in his set of sources.  But
these commands are necessarily driven from within a PO file window, and
it is likely that you do not even have such a PO file yet.  This is not
a problem at all, as you may safely open a new, empty PO file, mainly
for using these commands.  This empty PO file will slowly fill in while
you mark strings as translatable in your program sources.

‘,’
     Search through program sources for a string which looks like a
     candidate for translation (‘po-tags-search’).

‘M-,’
     Mark the last string found with ‘_()’ (‘po-mark-translatable’).

‘M-.’
     Mark the last string found with a keyword taken from a set of
     possible keywords.  This command with a prefix allows some
     management of these keywords (‘po-select-mark-and-mark’).

   The ‘,’ (‘po-tags-search’) command searches for the next occurrence
of a string which looks like a possible candidate for translation, and
displays the program source in another Emacs window, positioned in such
a way that the string is near the top of this other window.  If the
string is too big to fit whole in this window, it is positioned so only
its end is shown.  In any case, the cursor is left in the PO file
window.  If the shown string would be better presented differently in
different native languages, you may mark it using ‘M-,’ or ‘M-.’.
Otherwise, you might rather ignore it and skip to the next string by
merely repeating the ‘,’ command.

   A string is a good candidate for translation if it contains a
sequence of three or more letters.  A string containing at most two
letters in a row will be considered as a candidate if it has more
letters than non-letters.  The command disregards strings containing no
letters, or isolated letters only.  It also disregards strings within
comments, or strings already marked with some keyword PO mode knows (see
below).

   If you have never told Emacs about some ‘TAGS’ file to use, the
command will request that you specify one from the minibuffer, the first
time you use the command.  You may later change your ‘TAGS’ file by
using the regular Emacs command ‘M-x visit-tags-table’, which will ask
you to name the precise ‘TAGS’ file you want to use.  *Note Tag Tables:
(emacs)Tags.

   Each time you use the ‘,’ command, the search resumes from where it
was left by the previous search, and goes through all program sources,
obeying the ‘TAGS’ file, until all sources have been processed.
However, by giving a prefix argument to the command (‘C-u ,’), you may
request that the search be restarted all over again from the first
program source; but in this case, strings that you recently marked as
translatable will be automatically skipped.

   Using this ‘,’ command does not prevent using of other regular Emacs
tags commands.  For example, regular ‘tags-search’ or
‘tags-query-replace’ commands may be used without disrupting the
independent ‘,’ search sequence.  However, as implemented, the _initial_
‘,’ command (or the ‘,’ command is used with a prefix) might also
reinitialize the regular Emacs tags searching to the first tags file,
this reinitialization might be considered spurious.

   The ‘M-,’ (‘po-mark-translatable’) command will mark the recently
found string with the ‘_’ keyword.  The ‘M-.’
(‘po-select-mark-and-mark’) command will request that you type one
keyword from the minibuffer and use that keyword for marking the string.
Both commands will automatically create a new PO file untranslated entry
for the string being marked, and make it the current entry (making it
easy for you to immediately proceed to its translation, if you feel like
doing it right away).  It is possible that the modifications made to the
program source by ‘M-,’ or ‘M-.’ render some source line longer than 80
columns, forcing you to break and re-indent this line differently.  You
may use the ‘O’ command from PO mode, or any other window changing
command from Emacs, to break out into the program source window, and do
any needed adjustments.  You will have to use some regular Emacs command
to return the cursor to the PO file window, if you want command ‘,’ for
the next string, say.

   The ‘M-.’ command has a few built-in speedups, so you do not have to
explicitly type all keywords all the time.  The first such speedup is
that you are presented with a _preferred_ keyword, which you may accept
by merely typing ‘<RET>’ at the prompt.  The second speedup is that you
may type any non-ambiguous prefix of the keyword you really mean, and
the command will complete it automatically for you.  This also means
that PO mode has to _know_ all your possible keywords, and that it will
not accept mistyped keywords.

   If you reply ‘?’ to the keyword request, the command gives a list of
all known keywords, from which you may choose.  When the command is
prefixed by an argument (‘C-u M-.’), it inhibits updating any program
source or PO file buffer, and does some simple keyword management
instead.  In this case, the command asks for a keyword, written in full,
which becomes a new allowed keyword for later ‘M-.’ commands.  Moreover,
this new keyword automatically becomes the _preferred_ keyword for later
commands.  By typing an already known keyword in response to ‘C-u M-.’,
one merely changes the _preferred_ keyword and does nothing more.

   All keywords known for ‘M-.’ are recognized by the ‘,’ command when
scanning for strings, and strings already marked by any of those known
keywords are automatically skipped.  If many PO files are opened
simultaneously, each one has its own independent set of known keywords.
There is no provision in PO mode, currently, for deleting a known
keyword, you have to quit the file (maybe using ‘q’) and reopen it
afresh.  When a PO file is newly brought up in an Emacs window, only
‘gettext’ and ‘_’ are known as keywords, and ‘gettext’ is preferred for
the ‘M-.’ command.  In fact, this is not useful to prefer ‘_’, as this
one is already built in the ‘M-,’ command.

A.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==============================

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===============================================================

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
     Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
          any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
          all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
     work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
     work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
     or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
     on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
     that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License
     to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
     to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
     herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
     parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
     from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
     it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
     specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
     the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                              NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
     DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than ‘show w’ and ‘show
c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF MOE GHOUL, 1 April 1989
     Moe Ghoul, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

A.2 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
